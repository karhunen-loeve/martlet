# martlet
Ergogen designed minimalist keyboard 

The Martlet is intended to be a minimalist keyboard that I plan to use primarily for traveling. I've previously used a low-profile Corne keyboard (42 keys). For this reason, the Martlet is intended to be based on the Corne design. The main difference is that it won't be a split design, and the keyboard will be wireless. Essentially, both halves of the Corne will be glued together. I might adjust the position of the little finger keys a bit to suit my anatomy.
